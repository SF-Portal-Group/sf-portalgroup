Strategic Factory portal functions.

## Setting up a new portal
1. **Site Settings > File Uploader:** Upload the SF footer image and a favicon to the *con* directory.
1. **Site Settings > Site-Wide Appearance > Site Footer:** Copy the contents of startup.html and startup.css into the appropriate sections (*Footer Row Three* and *Extra CSS* respectively). Choose a layout from the nav-options directory, and paste the code in the tabsToNav function in startup.html. Make sure to update colors, fonts, and other styles as needed to match storefront branding guidelines.
1. **Site Settings > Site-Wide Appearance > Upload Logo:** Upload the company logo to both the *Mobile Logo* and *Desktop Logo* inputs. (If the company has a mobile-specific logo, feel free to use that instead.)
1. **Site Settings > Site-Wide Appearance > Button Designer:** Toggle off the *active* checkbox.
1. Once you are done making changes on the portal, create a folder in archives and back up both the footer scripts and styles.
