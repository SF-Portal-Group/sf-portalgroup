Strategic Factory portal functions.

## Other setup steps
1. **Favicon:** Choose an image to serve as the favicon (browser tab icon). If larger than 192x192, scale it down to those dimensions, and save as PNG. Upload to the File Uploader (in the /con directory).

## To-do
* Overhaul for the shipping page; items table is very difficult to read on mobile. Would probably benefit from being laid out as something other than a table.
